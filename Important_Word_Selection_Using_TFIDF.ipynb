    "Extracting the most meaningful words from given corpora is chalenging task. In general sense, we may think that the word appearing more frequently is important word. However in any language there are some specific words which occur repeatedly in document. We called such word as a 'Stop words', like in english, \"in\", \"the\", \"with\", \"will\" are stopwords. Notice that these word carry very less information. Therefore the word frequency and it's distribution across various document can be used to calculate amount of information they carry. We use same notion in TF-IDF technique. The variations of TF-IDF are often used by serach engines to rank document relevence given the user query.\n",

    "                   \n",
    "2) Inverse Document Frequency - \n",
    "   It represents a occurence of word across various document. Stopwords has high frequency in one document and we use concept      that they are equally likely to occur more frequently in another document. Using this, we weigh down their importance.          Mathematically,\n",

In computer science AI research is defined as the study of \"intelligent agents\": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.

    "In 1905, Albert Einstein determined that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, and that the speed of light in a vacuum was independent of the motion of all observers. This was the theory of special relativity. It introduced a new framework for all of physics and proposed new concepts of space and time.Einstein then spent 10 years trying to include acceleration in the theory and published his theory of general relativity in 1915. In it, he determined that massive objects cause a distortion in space-time, which is felt as gravity.\n",
